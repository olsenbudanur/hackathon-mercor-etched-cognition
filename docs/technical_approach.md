### Key Components

1. **EEG Device**: Captures brain signals (real or simulated)
2. **EEG Processor**: Analyzes EEG signals to extract attention metrics
3. **MoE Controller**: Routes generation through different experts based on attention levels
4. **Language Model**: Generates text with parameters adapted by the MoE controller
5. **Token Streaming Backend**: Handles streaming of tokens to the frontend
6. **Frontend Visualization**: Displays the generated text with expert-specific styling

### Data Flow

1. EEG signals are captured from the user's brain or simulated
2. The EEG processor analyzes the signals to extract attention metrics
3. The MoE controller uses attention metrics to determine expert weights
4. The language model generates tokens with parameters adapted by the MoE controller
5. Generated tokens are streamed to the frontend via the backend
6. The frontend visualizes the tokens with different colors based on the expert

## EEG Signal Processing

### Frequency Band Analysis

EEG signals are analyzed in the frequency domain to extract power in different frequency bands:

- **Theta (4-7 Hz)**: Associated with drowsiness, inattention
- **Alpha (8-13 Hz)**: Associated with relaxation, meditation
- **Beta (14-30 Hz)**: Associated with active thinking, focus
- **Gamma (31-50 Hz)**: Associated with cognitive processing, attention

The power in each frequency band is computed using Welch's method for power spectral density estimation:

```python
def compute_band_power(data, fs, band):
    """Compute the power in a specific frequency band of an EEG signal."""
    freqs, psd = welch(data, fs, nperseg=fs)
    return np.trapz(psd[(freqs >= band[0]) & (freqs <= band[1])])
```

### Attention Metrics

Attention metrics are derived from the relative power in different frequency bands:

1. **Focus Index**: Ratio of beta power to the sum of alpha and theta power
   ```python
   focus_index = beta_power / (alpha_power + theta_power)
   ```

2. **Attention Level**: Categorized as low, medium, or high based on thresholds
   ```python
   if focus_index < LOW_THRESHOLD:
       attention_level = "low"
   elif focus_index < HIGH_THRESHOLD:
       attention_level = "medium"
   else:
       attention_level = "high"
   ```

### Signal Processing Pipeline

1. **Data Collection**: EEG data is collected in chunks from the LSL stream
2. **Windowing**: The data is divided into overlapping windows (e.g., 2-second windows with 1-second overlap)
3. **Frequency Analysis**: Each window is analyzed to compute power in different frequency bands
4. **Attention Metrics**: Attention metrics are computed from the frequency band powers
5. **Smoothing**: Metrics are smoothed over time to reduce noise and prevent rapid fluctuations

## Mixture-of-Experts Architecture

The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture dynamically routes token generation through different "expert" configurations based on the user's attention level.

### Expert Configurations

The system implements three expert configurations:

1. **Simplicity Expert (Low Attention)**
   - **Purpose**: Generate simpler, more accessible text when attention is low
   - **Parameters**:
     - Higher temperature (e.g., 0.9-1.2) for more varied, simpler outputs
     - Lower top-k (e.g., 20-50) to focus on common tokens
     - Higher repetition penalty (e.g., 1.2-1.5) to avoid complex structures
     - Token biasing toward common words and simplifying phrases

2. **Balanced Expert (Medium Attention)**
   - **Purpose**: Generate balanced text with moderate complexity
   - **Parameters**:
     - Moderate temperature (e.g., 0.7-0.9)
     - Moderate top-k (e.g., 50-100)
     - Standard repetition penalty (e.g., 1.1-1.2)
     - Balanced token distribution without strong biasing

3. **Complexity Expert (High Attention)**
   - **Purpose**: Generate more complex, information-dense text when attention is high
   - **Parameters**:
     - Lower temperature (e.g., 0.5-0.7) for more deterministic, focused outputs
     - Higher top-k (e.g., 100-200) allowing for more specialized tokens
     - Lower repetition penalty (e.g., 1.0-1.1) to allow complex structures
     - Token biasing toward rare/technical tokens and complex phrases

### Dynamic Routing

The MoE controller dynamically routes token generation through the experts based on the current attention level:

1. **Expert Weighting**: Weights are assigned to each expert based on the attention level
   ```python
   # Example weighting function
   def compute_expert_weights(attention_level):
       if attention_level == "low":
           return {"simple": 0.7, "balanced": 0.2, "complex": 0.1}
       elif attention_level == "medium":
           return {"simple": 0.2, "balanced": 0.6, "complex": 0.2}
       else:  # high
           return {"simple": 0.1, "balanced": 0.2, "complex": 0.7}
   ```

2. **Parameter Interpolation**: Generation parameters are interpolated based on expert weights
   ```python
   # Example parameter interpolation
   temperature = (
       simple_weight * simple_temperature +
       balanced_weight * balanced_temperature +
       complex_weight * complex_temperature
   )
   ```

3. **Token Biasing**: Token probabilities are adjusted based on expert weights
   ```python
   # Example token biasing
   for token_id, bias in token_biases.items():
       logits[token_id] += (
           simple_weight * simple_bias[token_id] +
           balanced_weight * balanced_bias[token_id] +
           complex_weight * complex_bias[token_id]
       )
   ```

## Language Model Integration

### Token Generation Process

The language model generates tokens one by one, with each token's generation parameters adapted based on the current attention level:

1. **Input Processing**: The input prompt is tokenized and encoded
2. **Attention Sampling**: The current attention level is sampled from the EEG processor
3. **Expert Weighting**: Expert weights are computed based on the attention level
4. **Parameter Adaptation**: Generation parameters are adapted based on expert weights
5. **Token Generation**: A token is generated using the adapted parameters
6. **Expert Assignment**: The token is assigned to the expert with the highest weight
7. **Token Streaming**: The token and its expert are sent to the token streaming backend
8. **Repeat**: Steps 2-7 are repeated for each token until generation is complete

### Parameter Adaptation

The language model's parameters are adapted in real-time based on the attention level:

1. **Temperature**: Controls the randomness of token selection
   - Higher temperature for low attention (more varied, simpler outputs)
   - Lower temperature for high attention (more deterministic, focused outputs)

2. **Top-k Sampling**: Limits token selection to the top k most likely tokens
   - Lower top-k for low attention (focus on common tokens)
   - Higher top-k for high attention (allow for more specialized tokens)

3. **Repetition Penalty**: Penalizes repetition of tokens
   - Higher penalty for low attention (avoid complex structures)
   - Lower penalty for high attention (allow complex structures)

4. **Token Biasing**: Adjusts token probabilities
   - Bias toward common words for low attention
   - Bias toward rare/technical words for high attention

## Token Streaming

The token streaming backend handles the streaming of tokens from the language model to the frontend:

1. **Token Queue**: Tokens are added to a queue with their associated experts
   ```python
   token_queue.append({
       "word": token,
       "number": EXPERT_COLORS[expert]
   })
   ```

2. **Server-Sent Events**: Tokens are streamed to the frontend using server-sent events
   ```python
   async def event_stream():
       while True:
           if token_queue:
               data = token_queue.popleft()
               yield f"data: {json.dumps(data)}\n\n"
               await asyncio.sleep(0.1 + random.random() * 0.1)
           else:
               await asyncio.sleep(0.2)
   ```

3. **Color Mapping**: Each expert is mapped to a color for visualization
   ```python
   EXPERT_COLORS = {
       "simple": 1,     # Maps to color 1 in frontend (e.g., blue)
       "balanced": 2,   # Maps to color 2 in frontend (e.g., green)
       "complex": 3,    # Maps to color 3 in frontend (e.g., red)
       "unknown": 2     # Default to balanced/middle color if expert is unknown
   }
   ```

## Frontend Visualization

The frontend visualizes the streamed tokens with different colors based on the expert:

1. **EventSource**: Establishes a connection to the token streaming endpoint
   ```javascript
   const eventSource = new EventSource('/stream');
   eventSource.onmessage = (event) => {
       const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
       displayToken(data.word, data.number);
   };
   ```

2. **Token Display**: Displays tokens with different colors based on the expert
   ```javascript
   function displayToken(word, expertColor) {
       const tokenElement = document.createElement('span');
       tokenElement.textContent = word;
       tokenElement.className = `expert-${expertColor}`;
       outputContainer.appendChild(tokenElement);
   }
   ```

3. **Visualization Components**: Additional components visualize attention levels and expert weights
   - Attention level gauge
   - Expert weight distribution chart
   - Token generation statistics
